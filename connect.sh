#  1. Stopping any old ngrok instances.
#  2. Starting a new ngrok HTTP tunnel on port 2009.
#  3. Using the ngrok API to get the public URL.
#  4. Saving the URL to a file named 'connected_info.log'.
#  5. Committing the file to Git with a timestamped message.
#  6. Pushing the commit to the 'origin' remote.
